    "# Playing and saving synthesized acoustic signals\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "most notably the radiated sound pressure signal or acoustic signal in short. Both [lt.sim()](../api_basic.rst#letalker.sim) and [lt.sim_kinematic()](../api_basic.rst#letalker.sim_kinematic) functions return two objects: `pout` and `res`. The former is a length-`N` vector of the acoustic signal samples at the system sampling rate, which could be found as `lt.fs`. The `N` is the number of samples that you requested when calling [lt.sim()](../api_basic.rst#letalker.sim) or [lt.sim_kinematic()](../api_basic.rst#letalker.sim_kinematic) function. The second output `res` is a dict of simulation results generated by each of 5 elements of the model: `res['lungs']`, `res['trachea']`, `res['vocalfolds']`, `res['vocaltract']`, and `res['lips']`. These `Results` objects host both the element configurations as well as recorded samples of their internal signals.\n",

    "This example demonstrates how to plot the simulation outcomes using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). If you are not familiar with Matplotlib, please follow [their Getting Started Guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/) to install the library."
