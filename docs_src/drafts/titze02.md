## Derivation of the glottal flow update given subglottal and epilaryngeal pressures and glottal area

By Bernoulli principle, the kinetic pressure drop across the glottis equals the (adjusted) pressure drop from subglottis $P_s$ to supraglottis (epilarynx) $P_e$:
$$
P_{kd} = \frac{\rho}{2 a_d^2} u = \frac{1}{1-k_e}(P_s - P_e),
$$
where $a_d$ is the glottal area, $k_e$ is the pressure recovery coefficient (Ishizaka & Flanagan, 1972), subglottal pressure $P_s$, and
epilaryngeal pressure $P_e$.



## basics

Bernoulli’s Principle:
$$
P_\Delta = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_\Delta^2 = \frac{1}{2}\rho \left(\frac{U}{A}\right)^2
$$
where $P_\Delta$ is the pressure difference in N/m² or kg-s/m³, $\rho$ is the (air) density in kg/m³, and $v_\Delta$ is the particle velocity difference in m/s.

Relationship between volume flow (rate) and particle velocity:
$$
U = A v
$$
where $U$ is the flow rate in m/s³, $A$ is the cross-sectional area in m², $v$ is the particle velocity in m/s.
