  abstract = {Many voice disorders induce subharmonic phonation, but voice signal analysis is currently lacking a technique to detect the presence of subharmonics reliably. Distinguishing subharmonic phonation from normal phonation is a challenging task as both are nearly periodic phenomena. Subharmonic phonation adds cyclical variations to the normal glottal cycles. Hence, the estimation of subharmonic period requires a wholistic analysis of the signals. Deep learning is an effective solution to this type of complex problem. This paper describes fully convolutional neural networks which are trained with synthesized subharmonic voice signals to classify the subharmonic periods. Synthetic evaluation shows over 98\% classification accuracy, and assessment of sustained vowel recordings demonstrates encouraging outcomes as well as the areas for future improvements.},

  abstract = {PurposeTo relate vocal fold structure and kinematics to 2 acoustic measures: cepstral peak prominence (CPP) and the amplitude of the first harmonic relative to the second (H1-H2). MethodThe authors used a computational, kinematic model of the medial surfaces of the vocal folds to specify features of vocal fold structure and vibration in a manner consistent with breathy voice. Four model parameters were altered: degree of vocal fold adduction, surface bulging, vibratory nodal point, and supraglottal constriction. CPP and H1-H2 were measured from simulated glottal area, glottal flow, and acoustic waveforms and were related to the underlying vocal fold kinematics. ResultsCPP decreased with increased separation of the vocal processes, whereas the nodal point location had little effect. H1-H2 increased as a function of separation of the vocal processes in the range of 1.0 mm to 1.5 mm and decreased with separation {$>$} 1.5 mm. ConclusionsCPP is generally a function of vocal process separation. H1*-H2* (see paragraph 6 of article text for an explanation of the asterisks) will increase or decrease with vocal process separation on the basis of vocal fold shape, pivot point for the rotational mode, and supraglottal vocal tract shape, limiting its utility as an indicator of breathy voice. Future work will relate the perception of breathiness to vocal fold kinematics and acoustic measures.},

  abstract = {Purpose: In this study, the authors sought to determine (a) how specific vocal fold structural and vibratory features relate to breathy voice quality and (b) the relation of perceived breathiness to 4 acoustic correlates of breathiness. Method: A computational, kinematic model of the vocal fold medial surfaces was used to specify features of vocal fold structure and vibration in a manner consistent with breathy voice. Four model parameters were altered: vocal process separation, surface bulging, vibratory nodal point, and epilaryngeal constriction. Twelve naBve listeners rated breathiness of 364 samples relative to a reference. The degree of breathiness was then compared to (a) the underlying kinematic profile and (b) 4 acoustic measures: cepstral peak prominence (CPP), harmonics-to-noise ratio, and two measures of spectral slope. Results: Vocal process separation alone accounted for 61.4\% of the variance in perceptual rating. Adding nodal point ratio and bulging to the equation increased the explained variance to 88.7\%. The acoustic measure CPP accounted for 86.7\% of the variance in perceived breathiness, and explained variance increased to 92.6\% with the addition of one spectral slope measure. Conclusion: Breathiness ratings were best explained kinematically by the degree of vocal process separation and acoustically by CPP.},

  abstract = {Purpose  Computational modeling was used to examine the consequences of 5 different laryngeal asymmetries on acoustic and perceptual measures of vocal function. Method  A kinematic vocal fold model was used to impose 5 laryngeal asymmetries: adduction, edge bulging, nodal point ratio, amplitude of vibration, and starting phase. Thirty /a/ and /ɪ/ vowels were generated for each asymmetry and analyzed acoustically using cepstral peak prominence (CPP), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), and 3 measures of spectral slope (H1*-H2*, B0-B1, and B0-B2). Twenty listeners rated voice quality for a subset of the productions. Results  Increasingly asymmetric adduction, bulging, and nodal point ratio explained significant variance in perceptual rating (R2 = .05, p {$<$} .001). The same factors resulted in generally decreasing CPP, HNR, and B0-B2 and in increasing B0-B1. Of the acoustic measures, only CPP explained significant variance in perceived quality (R2 = .14, p {$<$} .001). Increasingly asymmetric amplitude of vibration or starting phase minimally altered vocal function or voice quality. Conclusion  Asymmetries of adduction, bulging, and nodal point ratio drove acoustic measures and perception in the current study, whereas asymmetric amplitude of vibration and starting phase demonstrated minimal influence on the acoustic signal or voice quality.

  abstract = {Comparison is drawn between male and female larynges on the basis of overall size, vocal fold membranous length, elastic properties of tissue, and prephonatory glottal shape. Two scale factors are proposed that are useful for explaining differences in fundamental frequency, sound power, mean airflow, and glottal efficiency. Fundamental frequency is scaled primarily according to the membranous length of the vocal folds (scale factor of 1.6), whereas mean airflow, sound power, glottal efficiency, and amplitude of vibration include another scale factor (1.2) that relates to overall larynx size. Some explanations are given for observed sex differences in glottographic waveforms. In particular, the simulated (computer-modeled) vocal fold contact area is used to infer male--female differences in the shape of the glottis. The female glottis appears to converge more linearly (from bottom to top) than the male glottis, primarily because of medial surface bulging of the male vocal folds.},
